Most important thing:
**Install the clipspy to ensure that the code (from clips import Environment) can be used**
1) Open VS Code
2) In the Terminal -> New Terminal
3) Run:
   pip install clipspy
4) After run, you can run the example.py to test your clipspy is download successful or not. If yes, print("You're Smart!!!). If no, try to solve it hahahaahahaah.
